Project 2 in FYS-STK4155 by Polina Dobrovolskaia and Ingrid Utseth

# LinearRegression
This script contains all the functions necessary to estimate the Ising energy from a generated set of spin variables. Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge Regression and the Lasso are used, and with the bootstrap algorithm, one can evaluate the fit using the estimate MSE, R2-score, bias and variance. 


# LogisticRegression
This file contains all the functions necessary for a binary classification of spin lattices using logistic regression and gradient descent methods. 

## ReadData
Reads the data obtained from "A high-bias, low-variance introduction to Machine Learning for physicists". This data is used to train and evaluate the logistic regression classifier. 

## test_logreg
Tests the logistic regression method.
